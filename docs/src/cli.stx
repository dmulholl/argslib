### Options

Options can have an unlimited number of long-form aliases and single-character shortcuts: `--option`, `-o`.

Options can have string, integer, or floating-point values.
Option values can be separated by either a space, `--option 123`, or an equals symbol, `--option=123`. Either syntax can be used with shortcuts: `-o 123`, `-o=123`.

Multiple shortcuts can be condensed into a single block, e.g. `-abc foo bar`. Trailing arguments are consumed in sequence as required by the options.



### Multivalued Options

Options can be treated as singular or multivalued as circumstances require. Each option maintains an internal list to which newly parsed values are appended; the (singular) value of the option is the final value in the list or the default value if the list is empty.

For example, in the command below:

    $ my_app --foo 123 --foo 456

the value of the option `foo` is `456` but the list `[123, 456]` is also available for use if required.



### Flags

Flags are valueless options â€” they're either present or absent, but take no arguments. Like options, flags can have an unlimited number of long-form aliases and single-character shortcuts: `--flag`, `-f`.



### Positional Arguments

Options and flags can be preceded by, followed by, or interspaced with positional arguments.

Argslib supports the standard `--` switch for turning off option-parsing. All arguments following a `--` will be treated as positional arguments, even if they begin with a single or double dash.



### Quoted Values

Note that you can use quotes to surround argument and option values containing spaces, e.g.

::: code
    $ my_app "arg 1" "arg 2"
    $ my_app --option "value with spaces"
    $ my_app --option="value with spaces"
    $ my_app -o="value with spaces"

This isn't a feature of the library --- the quotes are processed by the shell and the library only sees the resulting string values, including spaces.



### Commands

Argslib supports git-style command interfaces with arbitrarily-nested commands. Commands have builtin support for an automatic `--help` flag and an automatic `help <cmd>` command, i.e. the commands

    $ my_app <cmd> --help

and

    $ my_app help <cmd>

are functionally identical and will both print the help text registered with the command.



### Non-Unicode Arguments

To keep its API simple, this library only works with command line arguments which are valid unicode strings. If the parser finds an argument which is not a valid unicode string the `.parse()` method will raise an `ArgsError` exception.



### Negative Numbers

Some argument-parsing libraries struggle with negative numbers --- for example, they will try to parse `-3` as a flag or option named `3`. This library always treats arguments beginning with a dash and a digit as positional arguments or option values, never as flag or option names.
